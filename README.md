* The bamazon app is an Amazon-like storefront that uses mysql to hold inventory in a database. The app operates in the command line with node.js dependencies. 

* The user is able to pull up the list of available inventory, choose a product, and make a purchase. Upon purchase quantities are updated. Additionally, the user is shown the total price of their purchase.

* The app will take in only available selections from the user. If the item is out of stock or if the user enters a nonexistent products, relevant error messages are shown.

* Additional functionality will be added to this app in time. Specifically: introducing a manager and supervisor view with access to additional data. This project is maintained by Rick Clark.
